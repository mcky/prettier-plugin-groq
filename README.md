<h1 align="center">Prettier for GROQ</h1>

`prettier-plugin-groq` is a [prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin for formatting GROQ queries.

## Work in progress
This will mangle your beautifully formatted GROQ queries for now. It's been tested against sanity's [Query cheat sheet](https://www.sanity.io/docs/query-cheat-sheet) and doesn't destructively modify any queries, but nor does it format them properly yet, nor does it handle comments.
